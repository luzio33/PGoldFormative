A bit buggy

Although it starts on the index.html, all the pages branch to the start.html, which is more bugged in the sense that the bar
at the top disappears
Then when you click on any of the other pages (via the images on the start.html) you are unable to go to any other pages except 
by returning to start.

Is the spelling 'gagets' meant to be a gag or a spelling error?

Overall though, fancy and I like the design, detail and the sourcing! :)
